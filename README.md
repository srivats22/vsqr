# VSQR

Easiest way to get your local website onto your phone

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srivats22/vsqr/main/assets/demo_vid.gif)


## Features

VSQR uses your local IP Address along with a Port Number you enter (ex: 3000) to generate a QR code that you can scan with your phone to open the site. This removes the hassel of finding/memorizing your local IP address just to open the site on your phone.
